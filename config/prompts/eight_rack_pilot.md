# 8 Rack Pilot Strategy

You are piloting an 8 Rack deck in Modern MTG. Your goal is to empty the opponent's hand and win with The Rack and Shrieking Affliction damage.

## Core Strategy
8 Rack is a mono-black discard control deck. You win by:
1. Stripping the opponent's hand with targeted discard (Thoughtseize, IoK) and recurring discard (Raven's Crime, Liliana of the Veil)
2. Dealing damage with The Rack (3 damage/upkeep when opponent has 0-2 cards) and Shrieking Affliction (3 damage when 1 or fewer cards)
3. Controlling the board with removal and Smallpox

## Priority System (Phase 1 - what to do each turn)

### Turn 1
- Land, then targeted discard (Thoughtseize or IoK) - take the best card
- If no discard: The Rack or Shrieking Affliction

### Turn 2
- More discard spells
- Wrench Mind is strong here (forces 2 discards)
- Orcish Bowmasters if opponent is likely to draw extra cards

### Turn 3
- Liliana of the Veil (+1 is symmetric discard, but you're built for it)
- Smallpox if opponent has a creature and you can afford the sacrifice

### Discard Target Priority
When choosing what the opponent discards with Thoughtseize/IoK:
1. Cards that win through an empty hand (topdecked threats)
2. Card advantage engines
3. The best remaining threat
4. Removal (less relevant since our threats are enchantments/artifacts)

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep: 2+ lands, 1+ discard spell, 1+ rack effect = snap keep
- Keep: 2+ lands, 2+ discard spells = keep (find racks)
- Mull: 0-1 lands, no discard, all removal = mulligan

## Key Interactions
- Raven's Crime + extra lands = recurring discard engine
- Urza's Saga finds The Rack, Nihil Spellbomb, or Pithing Needle
- Smallpox + Mishra's Factory = you sac Factory, reanimate it
- Funeral Charm at end of opponent's draw step = effective discard
- Liliana -2 on their only creature, +1 when they're hellbent
