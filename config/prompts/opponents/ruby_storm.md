# Ruby Storm Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Ruby Storm is a fast combo deck that chains ritual spells (Pyretic Ritual, Desperate Ritual) with impulse draw effects (Wrenn's Resolve, Reckless Impulse) to generate a lethal storm count. Ruby Medallion reduces costs to enable longer chains, and the deck finishes with Grapeshot or an army of tokens from Empty the Warrens. Ral, Monsoon Mage provides an additional engine that rewards casting instants and sorceries.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Ruby Medallion**: The most important card. Reducing spell costs by 1 turns marginal chains into lethal ones. Protect and deploy ASAP.
- **Ral, Monsoon Mage**: Functions as both a mana engine and a win condition. Transforms after casting enough spells.
- **Pyretic Ritual / Desperate Ritual**: Core mana generation. These are the fuel for the combo turn.
- **Wrenn's Resolve / Reckless Impulse**: Impulse draw that keeps the chain going. Cast these to find more rituals.
- **Past in Flames**: The recovery card. Gives all instants and sorceries in the graveyard flashback, enabling a second wave.
- **Grapeshot**: Primary win condition via storm copies.
- **Manamorphose**: Free cantrip that fixes mana and increases storm count.

## Mulligan Guide
- Always keep hands with Ruby Medallion and 2+ lands.
- Hands with Ral, Monsoon Mage plus rituals and draw spells are keepable.
- Avoid hands that are all rituals with no draw effects, or all draw with no mana generation.
- A fast hand can win on turn 3; a typical goldfish is turn 3-4.
- Mulligan aggressively for Ruby Medallion or Ral in game 1.
- Post-board, consider keeping hands with Orim's Chant to force through the combo.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 4 Orim's Chant (prevents discard on combo turn), 1 Empty the Warrens (alternate win condition)
- **Out**: 2 Artist's Talent (too slow), 2 Strike It Rich (weakest ritual), 1 Glimpse the Impossible
- **Strategy**: 8 Rack's discard is problematic but beatable. The key is speed: try to combo before they strip too many cards. Orim's Chant on the combo turn prevents any interaction. If they deploy Shrieking Affliction and The Rack early, there is a clock pressuring you, so do not play a slow game. Empty the Warrens for 6-8 goblins can be enough if cast early since 8 Rack has very limited creature removal. Avoid letting them see your hand with Thoughtseize before you are ready to go off. If possible, hold key combo pieces and deploy them all in one turn.
