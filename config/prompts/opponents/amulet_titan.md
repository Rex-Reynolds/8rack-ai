# Amulet Titan Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Amulet Titan is a land-based combo-ramp deck that uses Amulet of Vigor to untap bounce lands (like Gruul Turf) as they enter the battlefield, generating extra mana. The deck ramps into Primeval Titan, which fetches key lands to either deal lethal damage or generate overwhelming value. Spelunking provides a redundant Amulet effect while also granting haste. The deck can win as early as turn 3 with the right draws.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Amulet of Vigor**: The namesake card. Untaps bounce lands for explosive mana. Having two in play is game-winning.
- **Primeval Titan**: The primary win condition. Fetches two lands on attack, typically Urza's Saga plus a utility land, or a bounce land to continue the chain.
- **Spelunking**: Redundant Amulet effect plus grants haste to creatures, allowing Primeval Titan to attack immediately.
- **Arboreal Grazer**: Ramp on turn 1, putting a bounce land into play with Amulet for an explosive start.
- **Scapeshift**: Alternative win condition that converts lands into a lethal configuration.
- **Urza's Saga**: Creates large Construct tokens and tutors for Amulet of Vigor.
- **Summoner's Pact / Green Sun's Zenith**: Tutors to find Primeval Titan or utility creatures.

## Mulligan Guide
- Always keep hands with Amulet of Vigor plus bounce lands and ramp.
- Natural Primeval Titan hands (castable by turn 3-4) are keepable.
- Hands with Urza's Saga and Amulet are strong; Saga finds the missing pieces.
- Avoid keeping hands with no Amulet, no ramp, and no tutor.
- Spelunking hands without other acceleration are keepable but slower.
- Mulligan aggressively in combo matchups; you need to be fast.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 2 Force of Vigor (free removal for The Rack and Shrieking Affliction), 1 Bojuka Bog
- **Out**: 3 Dismember (no relevant creatures to kill)
- **Strategy**: Amulet Titan is well-positioned against 8 Rack. The deck operates largely off the top of the deck and from lands, making hand disruption less effective. Primeval Titan does not need to be in your hand to win; Summoner's Pact and Green Sun's Zenith can find it. Urza's Saga creates Constructs that pressure the opponent regardless of hand size. Force of Vigor is devastating, destroying two of their enchantments for free. The main vulnerability is a very fast Thoughtseize into Liliana start that can slow you down enough for Rack effects to deal lethal. Prioritize deploying Amulet early and ramping past their disruption.
