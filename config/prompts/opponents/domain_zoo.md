# Domain Zoo Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Domain Zoo is an aggressive multicolor deck that exploits Leyline of the Guildpact to achieve full domain (all 5 basic land types) from turn 0. This powers up Territorial Kavu as a massive beater, enables Scion of Draco to grant keyword abilities to all creatures, and makes Leyline Binding a 1-mana removal spell. The deck combines raw aggression with efficient interaction for a fast, resilient beatdown strategy.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Leyline of the Guildpact**: The deck's engine. Starting with this in your opening hand transforms the entire deck. It makes all creatures all colors (enabling Scion of Draco) and all lands all types (enabling domain).
- **Territorial Kavu**: 5/5 for 2 mana with domain active. Attacks through most blockers and can exile cards from graveyards.
- **Scion of Draco**: When all creatures are all colors (via Leyline), Scion grants first strike, vigilance, hexproof, trample, and lifelink to your entire board.
- **Leyline Binding**: 1-mana exile removal with full domain. Answers nearly anything.
- **Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer**: Fast mana and card advantage. Best turn 1 play when Leyline is not in the opener.
- **Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury**: Recurring threat that provides removal and stabilization.
- **Stubborn Denial**: With a 4+ power creature (easy with Kavu or Scion), this is a 1-mana Negate.

## Mulligan Guide
- Hands with Leyline of the Guildpact are almost always keeps. The card is that important.
- Without Leyline, look for Ragavan plus removal and a 2-3 land hand.
- Mulligan aggressively for Leyline in matchups where domain matters most.
- Avoid keeping slow hands without Leyline; the deck underperforms without it.
- Post-board, keep hands that have interaction for the opponent's key cards.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 2 Wear // Tear (hits The Rack and Shrieking Affliction), 1 Nihil Spellbomb
- **Out**: 2 Stubborn Denial (fewer instants to counter), 1 Consign to Memory
- **Strategy**: Domain Zoo's speed is its primary advantage against 8 Rack. With Leyline of the Guildpact, a turn 2 Territorial Kavu is a 5/5 that threatens to end the game in 4 attacks. Scion of Draco granting hexproof to your board makes targeted discard less effective at slowing you down (though they can still take Scion itself). Leyline Binding answers any problematic permanent they deploy. Phlage escaping from the graveyard is excellent against a deck trying to empty your hand. Play fast and force them to have answers. Wear // Tear is important for removing their damage enchantments.
