# Yawgmoth Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Yawgmoth is a creature-combo deck built around Yawgmoth, Thran Physician. The combo involves Yawgmoth plus two undying creatures (Young Wolf, Strangleroot Geist): sacrifice one to draw a card and put a -1/-1 counter on the other (removing its +1/+1 counter from undying), then sacrifice the second to repeat. This draws the entire deck and drains the opponent's life total with Walking Ballista or Blood Artist-style effects. The deck also functions as a solid Golgari midrange deck when the combo is not available.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Yawgmoth, Thran Physician**: The combo engine. Sacrifice creatures to draw cards and distribute -1/-1 counters. Must be protected at all costs.
- **Young Wolf**: Key undying creature for the combo. Comes back with a +1/+1 counter when it dies.
- **Walking Ballista**: Win condition. With infinite draw from the combo, deploy Ballista for lethal.
- **Agatha's Soul Cauldron**: Exiles creatures from graveyards and puts +1/+1 counters on your creatures, granting them abilities. Can give undying to non-undying creatures.
- **Delighted Halfling**: Ramp and protection. Makes Yawgmoth uncounterable when cast.
- **Badgermole Cub**: Undying creature that synergizes with the combo.
- **Green Sun's Zenith**: Tutors for any green creature. Finds combo pieces or silver bullets.
- **Malevolent Rumble**: Card selection that finds creatures and fills the graveyard.
- **Grist, the Hunger Tide**: Tutorable planeswalker (it is a creature in all other zones) that provides removal and token generation.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep hands with Yawgmoth or a way to find him (Green Sun's Zenith) plus undying creatures.
- Delighted Halfling into turn 2 Yawgmoth is the dream; always keep this.
- Hands with Agatha's Soul Cauldron and creatures are strong backup plans.
- Avoid keeping hands with no path to the combo and no value engine.
- Malevolent Rumble hands are keepable since they dig toward combo pieces.
- Post-board, hands with Thoughtseize are valuable against combo and control.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 3 Thoughtseize (take their Rack effects), 1 Force of Vigor (destroys enchantments), 1 Abrupt Decay (answers anything)
- **Out**: 1 Kraul Harpooner (no flyers to fight), 1 Scavenging Ooze (less relevant), 3 Fatal Push (few targets)
- **Strategy**: Yawgmoth has a reasonable matchup against 8 Rack. Undying creatures are resilient to Liliana's -2 since they come back. Yawgmoth himself turns every creature into card draw, making it hard for 8 Rack to deplete your hand permanently. Green Sun's Zenith for X=0 finds Dryad Arbor, providing a creature without spending a card from hand. The combo can be assembled through disruption since individual pieces are not valuable targets for Thoughtseize. Agatha's Soul Cauldron provides graveyard-based value that ignores hand size. Prioritize assembling the combo over playing a fair game. Force of Vigor is excellent for destroying their enchantment-based damage.
