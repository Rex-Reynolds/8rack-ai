# Boros Energy Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Boros Energy is the dominant deck in Modern, combining efficient white and red creatures that generate energy counters with powerful synergy payoffs. The deck plays a proactive aggro-midrange game, deploying threats like Ocelot Pride and Guide of Souls early, then leveraging energy for card advantage and board dominance through Galvanic Discharge and Ajani, Nacatl Pariah. Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury provides recurring value as both removal and life gain.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Ocelot Pride**: Premier one-drop that creates token pressure and generates energy. Deploy turn 1 whenever possible.
- **Guide of Souls**: Enables energy generation on every creature entering the battlefield; provides incidental life gain and can grant evasion.
- **Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer**: Mana advantage and card advantage on attack. High priority turn 1 play on the draw.
- **Ajani, Nacatl Pariah**: Transforms into a planeswalker, providing board presence and removal resilience.
- **Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury**: Escape from the graveyard repeatedly; acts as both removal and stabilization.
- **Galvanic Discharge**: Flexible energy-fueled removal that scales with energy reserves.
- **Goblin Bombardment**: Sacrifice outlet that converts board presence into direct damage for closing games.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep hands with at least one 1-drop creature (Ocelot Pride, Guide of Souls, or Ragavan) plus lands to curve out.
- Hands with 2+ one-drops and 2-3 lands are premium keeps.
- Avoid keeping hands that are all removal and no threats. The deck needs to be proactive.
- Hands with Blood Moon are keepable against greedy manabases even if slightly slower.
- Mulligan aggressively for early plays; the deck recovers well with Seasoned Pyromancer and Phlage.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 2 Wear // Tear (hits The Rack and Shrieking Affliction), 1 Ghost Vacuum (stops Lurrus if applicable)
- **Out**: 2 Blood Moon (8 Rack runs mostly Swamps), 1 Goblin Bombardment
- **Strategy**: 8 Rack wants to empty your hand and punish you with enchantment-based damage. Prioritize deploying threats quickly before discard strips your hand. Ocelot Pride and Ragavan generate card advantage that fights through discard. Phlage is excellent since it can be escaped from the graveyard without needing cards in hand. Wear // Tear is critical for removing The Rack and Shrieking Affliction. Do not hold cards back; play everything aggressively to minimize the impact of discard spells. Topdecking creatures is fine since most of them generate immediate value.
