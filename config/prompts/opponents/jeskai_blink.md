# Jeskai Blink Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Jeskai Blink is a midrange-control deck that leverages Ephemerate and blink effects to reuse powerful enter-the-battlefield triggers from creatures like Solitude and Phlage. The deck grinds opponents out with repeated value while maintaining strong interaction through counterspells and removal. Teferi, Time Raveler locks opponents out of instant-speed play while enabling your own blink shenanigans at sorcery speed.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Solitude**: Free removal stapled to a 3/2 lifelinker. Blinking it with Ephemerate is the core value engine.
- **Ephemerate**: The key synergy card. Rebounds to blink a creature twice. Prioritize having a target before casting.
- **Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury**: Recurring removal and life gain. Excellent grindy card that escapes from the graveyard.
- **Quantum Riddler**: Generates card advantage and tempo through blink synergies.
- **Teferi, Time Raveler**: Shuts down instant-speed interaction and bounces opposing permanents. Enables sorcery-speed Ephemerate tricks.
- **Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer**: Early pressure and mana advantage.
- **Galvanic Discharge**: Efficient removal powered by energy generation.

## Mulligan Guide
- Prioritize hands with early interaction (Solitude, Prismatic Ending) plus a value engine (Ephemerate, Fable).
- Ragavan on turn 1 is excellent, especially on the play.
- Avoid keeping hands that are all reactive with no threats.
- Three-land hands with a mix of threats and answers are ideal.
- Teferi plus Ephemerate hands are excellent against interactive opponents.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 1 Wear // Tear, 1 Celestial Purge
- **Out**: 1 Wrath of the Skies, 1 Consign to Memory
- **Strategy**: This is a favorable matchup for Jeskai Blink. The deck generates so much card advantage through blink effects that 8 Rack's discard plan struggles to keep up. Solitude and Phlage both provide value from the graveyard or through repeated use, making them resilient to discard. Teferi bouncing The Rack or Shrieking Affliction is a massive tempo swing. Deploy Ragavan early to generate extra cards. Wear // Tear handles their enchantments cleanly. The main risk is falling to very low life from early Rack effects before stabilizing, so prioritize removing their damage sources.
