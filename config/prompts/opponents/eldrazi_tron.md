# Eldrazi Tron Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Eldrazi Tron combines the Urza Tron land package (Tower, Mine, Power Plant) with Eldrazi Temple to cast large colorless threats ahead of schedule. Karn, the Great Creator provides a toolbox sideboard that can be accessed game 1, while Thought-Knot Seer provides disruption and a clock. The deck aims to assemble Tron quickly via Expedition Map and then overwhelm opponents with haymakers like All Is Dust and Ulamog.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Karn, the Great Creator**: The deck's most versatile card. Fetches silver bullets from the sideboard and shuts off opposing artifacts. Deploy as soon as possible.
- **Thought-Knot Seer**: Disruption plus a 4/4 body. Cast this on turns 2-3 with Eldrazi Temple to strip key cards.
- **Ugin, Eye of the Storms**: Provides card filtering and cost reduction for colorless spells.
- **Devourer of Destiny**: Large threat that can be imprinted on Ugin's Labyrinth.
- **All Is Dust**: Board wipe that clears all colored permanents. Devastating against creature decks.
- **Expedition Map**: Finds the missing Tron piece or Eldrazi Temple. Prioritize fetching whatever completes Tron.
- **Chalice of the Void**: Lock piece that shuts down low-curve decks when set on 1.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep any hand with 2 Tron pieces and an Expedition Map.
- Natural Tron (all 3 pieces) in hand is a snap keep with any payoff.
- Eldrazi Temple plus Thought-Knot Seer on turn 2 is an excellent keep.
- Avoid keeping hands with no acceleration (no Tron pieces, no Temple, no Mind Stone).
- Chalice of the Void on 1 is a keepable hand against known aggro/combo opponents.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: Karn fetches are the primary plan. Fetch Liquimetal Coating to turn their enchantments into artifacts, then use Karn's static to shut them off. The Stone Brain can name The Rack or Shrieking Affliction.
- **Strategy**: This matchup heavily favors Eldrazi Tron. 8 Rack's discard is weak against a deck that topdecks haymakers and has inevitability. Thought-Knot Seer strips a key card while presenting a large body. Karn, the Great Creator with Liquimetal Coating effectively neutralizes their enchantment-based damage plan. All Is Dust is a clean answer to all their permanents. The main risk is an early Shrieking Affliction plus Thoughtseize start that deals significant damage before Tron comes online. Prioritize assembling Tron and deploying Karn. Once Karn resolves, the game is effectively over.
