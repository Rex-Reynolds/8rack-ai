# Neobrand Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Neobrand is an all-in combo deck that aims to win on turns 1-2 by cheating a massive creature into play using Neoform or Eldritch Evolution. The core line involves sacrificing Allosaurus Rider (cast for free by exiling two green cards) to Neoform, finding Griselbrand, drawing 14+ cards, and then assembling a lethal board. The deck is extremely fast but fragile, relying on protection spells like Pact of Negation and Veil of Summer to force through its combo.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Allosaurus Rider**: Free creature (costs 2 green cards from hand) that serves as sacrifice fodder for Neoform/Eldritch Evolution.
- **Neoform**: Sacrifices a creature to find one with higher mana value. Rider into Griselbrand or Ghalta.
- **Eldritch Evolution**: Similar to Neoform but at sorcery speed. Finds the combo pieces.
- **Griselbrand**: Draw 7 cards at a time to find more combo pieces and protection.
- **Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant**: Alternative target that puts all creatures from hand into play.
- **Atraxa, Grand Unifier**: Draws 10+ cards worth of selection on entry. Powerful Neoform/Evolution target.
- **Pact of Negation / Consign to Memory**: Free countermagic to protect the combo.
- **Veil of Summer**: Protection against discard and counterspells.
- **Summoner's Pact**: Finds Allosaurus Rider to start the combo.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep any hand that combos on turn 1-2 with protection.
- The ideal hand: Allosaurus Rider, 2 green cards to exile, Neoform, and a land.
- Always mulligan hands without a combo line, even at 5 cards.
- Summoner's Pact finding Rider is acceptable as a turn 2 line.
- Pact of Negation or Veil of Summer as backup is highly preferred.
- Do not keep hands that "might get there" -- this deck needs to be deterministic.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: Nothing specific needed; the combo is faster than their disruption plan.
- **Out**: Consider trimming 1 Consign to Memory (8 Rack has few instants to counter).
- **Strategy**: Neobrand is heavily favored against 8 Rack in game 1 since the combo is faster than their discard plan. However, Thoughtseize on turn 1 taking Neoform or Allosaurus Rider is devastating. Veil of Summer is critical: it counters Thoughtseize, draws a card, and gives hexproof for the turn. If you have a turn 1 combo with Veil of Summer backup, just go for it. The biggest risk is them having turn 1 Thoughtseize on the play followed by more discard. Post-board, they may bring in Surgical Extraction targeting Allosaurus Rider. Diversify your threats and use Planar Genesis and Summoner's Pact to maintain redundancy.
