# Goryo's Vengeance Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Goryo's Vengeance is a reanimator-combo deck that discards powerful legendary creatures (Atraxa, Grand Unifier or Griselbrand) and brings them back with the namesake instant. Combined with Ephemerate, the reanimated creature is blinked to remove the exile clause, leaving a permanent massive threat. Psychic Frog provides a discard outlet and an evasive threat, while Solitude offers free removal. The deck blends combo elements with a fair midrange backup plan.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Goryo's Vengeance**: The combo piece. Instant-speed reanimation of a legendary creature. Combined with Ephemerate, the creature stays permanently.
- **Atraxa, Grand Unifier**: Primary reanimation target. Draws 7+ cards on entry, overwhelming the opponent with card advantage.
- **Ephemerate**: Blinks the reanimated creature to remove the exile-at-end-of-turn clause. Also generates value with Solitude.
- **Psychic Frog**: Discard outlet that puts Atraxa/Griselbrand into the graveyard. Also a legitimate evasive threat that grows.
- **Solitude**: Free removal and a blink target. Pitching white cards for free exile removal.
- **Fallaji Archaeologist**: Filters draws and fills the graveyard with reanimation targets.
- **Emperor of Bones**: Alternative reanimation path that synergizes with the creature-heavy build.
- **Thoughtseize**: Disruption that clears the way for the combo.
- **Force of Negation**: Free countermagic to protect the combo turn.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep hands with a discard outlet (Psychic Frog, Tainted Indulgence) plus a reanimation target and Goryo's Vengeance.
- Hands with just Psychic Frog and lands are keepable; the frog can win on its own.
- Avoid hands with reanimation targets stuck in hand and no way to discard them.
- Ephemerate is important but do not mulligan specifically for it; you can find it off Atraxa's trigger.
- Thoughtseize hands are good against combo and control opponents.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 3 Quantum Riddler (grindy threat), 1 Teferi, Time Raveler (bounces enchantments)
- **Out**: 2 Force of Negation (few instants to counter), 1 Tainted Indulgence, 1 Faithful Mending
- **Strategy**: This matchup is interesting because both decks use discard, but Goryo's Vengeance benefits from having creatures in the graveyard. If 8 Rack forces you to discard Atraxa, that is actually enabling your game plan. Psychic Frog is excellent since it gives you a proactive discard outlet and a threat that grows. Solitude provides free interaction. The main concern is multiple Shrieking Afflictions dealing damage while you set up. Teferi, Time Raveler bouncing The Rack or Shrieking Affliction is very strong. Emperor of Bones reanimating creatures from the graveyard is another angle that benefits from their discard plan. Play the midrange game and punish them for filling your graveyard.
