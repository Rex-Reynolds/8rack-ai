# Affinity Pilot Strategy

## Archetype Overview
Modern Affinity is an artifact-synergy deck built around Urza's Saga and cheap artifacts. The deck deploys a critical mass of artifacts to power up Kappa Cannoneer (which gains ward and grows with each artifact entering) and Pinnacle Emissary. Mox Opal provides explosive mana, while Emry, Lurker of the Loch recurs artifacts from the graveyard for a persistent value engine. Weapons Manufacturing generates artifact tokens for synergy fuel.

## Key Cards and Priorities
- **Kappa Cannoneer**: Primary win condition. Grows with each artifact and has ward, making it hard to remove. Deploy when you have artifact flow to protect and grow it.
- **Mox Opal**: Enables explosive starts. Metalcraft is easy to achieve with Mishra's Bauble and zero-cost artifacts.
- **Urza's Saga**: Creates Construct tokens and tutors for key 0-1 cost artifacts. The land-based threat is hard to interact with.
- **Emry, Lurker of the Loch**: Recurring engine. Casts artifacts from graveyard, enabling repeated Mishra's Bauble draws and Engineered Explosives resets.
- **Weapons Manufacturing**: Generates artifact tokens passively, fueling Kappa Cannoneer, Mox Opal metalcraft, and Urza's Saga constructs.
- **Metallic Rebuke**: Cheap countermagic with artifact cost reduction. Hold up as protection for key threats.
- **Engineered Explosives**: Flexible removal for problematic permanents at various mana values.

## Mulligan Guide
- Keep hands with Mox Opal plus cheap artifacts and a threat (Kappa Cannoneer or Emry).
- Urza's Saga hands are keepable even without a fast clock since the land generates threats on its own.
- Avoid hands with expensive cards and no acceleration.
- Post-board, consider keeping hands with Consign to Memory or Force of Negation against combo decks.
- The deck mulligans poorly; try to keep 7-card hands that have a reasonable plan.

## Sideboard Guide vs 8 Rack
- **In**: 2 Galvanic Blast (removal flexibility), 2 Whipflare (clears any opposing creatures)
- **Out**: 2 Tormod's Crypt (irrelevant), 2 Metallic Rebuke (they play at sorcery speed)
- **Strategy**: Affinity is reasonably well-positioned against 8 Rack. Urza's Saga creates threats that do not require cards in hand, and Emry provides a graveyard-based engine that does not care about an empty hand. Kappa Cannoneer with ward is very difficult for 8 Rack to remove (they rely on Liliana's -2 or sacrifice effects). Deploy artifacts aggressively and do not worry about holding cards back -- the damage from The Rack and Shrieking Affliction is mitigated by having a fast clock. Engineered Explosives on 1 can clear Shrieking Affliction, and on 3 can hit The Rack. Weapons Manufacturing tokens keep the artifact count high for constructs and Cannoneer growth.
